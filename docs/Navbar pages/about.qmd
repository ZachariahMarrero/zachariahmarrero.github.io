::: {#about_text}
Keeping it short and simple...  This website is a place where I will share how to do things with data.

At the top of the page you can currently see a the words 'Accelerated Statistics.'  The content within covers some very basic, yet very important, lessons for statistical analysis.  Feel free to take a break from the current conversations about AI to review the contents here.  You will be surprised at the fun you can have once you understand the tools within.  

Furthermore, I will use a similar approach in the presentation and evaluation of popular machine learning algorithms in the years ahead. I'm currently sitting on a mountain of that I've accumulated over the course of my PhD studies (If you want to appreciate the flavor of this work, you can find my dissertation currently through my linkedin in the projects section). I will share methods and materials on how to approach the study of machine learning algorithms. In short, not algorithms are built the same and, currently, there is relatively little work demonstrating the properties of them. In my understanding of it, the math is still being discovered today. Fortunately, classical statistics provides us with a roadmap for how we can approach the evaluation of algorithms in the most general sense AND modern computers make it possible.
